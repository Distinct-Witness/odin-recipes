    <h1>These delicious Danish pastries are the pinnacle of sweet treats</h1>

    <h2>Dough:</h2>
    <ul>1 cup warm milk</ul>
    <ul>3 cakes cake yeast</ul>
    <ul>6.5 tbsp butter, room temperature</ul>
    <ul>2 eggs</ul>
    <ul>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</ul>
    <ul>2 tbsp white sugar</ul>
    <ul>1/4 tsp salt</ul>
    <ul>4 cups all-purpose flour</ul>

    <h2>Filling:</h2>
    <ul>2/3 cup butter</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup white sugar</ul>
    <ul>2 tbsp ground cinnamon</ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>Pour the warm milk into a mixing bowl and mash in the fresh cake yeast. Mix in 6 1/2 tablespoons of soft butter, eggs, cardamom, 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 3 1/2 cups of the flour.</ol>
    <ol>Use a wooden spoon to mix the dough. If it's very sticky, mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Cream together the 2/3 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir in the cinnamon.</ol>
    <ol>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it until it's firm, about 3 minutes. Divide the dough in half; roll each half into a rectangle no more than 1/2 inch thick. Spread each rectangle with half the filling.</ol>
    <ol>Stack one layer of dough and filling on top of the other rectangle of dough, filling-side up. Roll the dough up, starting with the edge closest to you, to form a long log. Cut the log into 1 inch-thick slices.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or grease a baking dish or two cake pans.</ol>
    <ol>Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart. If you like pull-apart rolls, arrange them in a greased baking dish or cake pans, spacing the rolls about 1 inch apart.</ol>
    <ol>Place the uneven end pieces on the baking sheet cut-side up for the best presentation. Let the rolls rest 20 minutes before baking.</ol>
    <ol>Bake the snails in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Pull-apart rolls will take longer to bake: after 10 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake the rolls until the sides are fully set, about 10 minutes longer.</ol>
    <ol>Cover the baking dish with foil if the rolls begin to get too brown.</ol>
